## MVP

[x] Show reasoning tokens in the UI
[x] Only launch with Deep Research (Disable reason search)
[x] Verify that backend doesn't timeout for this flow
[x] MultiModal Input refinement
- [x] Attachments should be removable
- [x] Message attachments should be inside message box when visualizing and editing
- [x] Attachments should work with drop zone
[x] Fix reserved credit release on crash
[x] Please wait until the message repsonse ends
[x] Create / Edit document should have more context of the conversation than a description
[x] Document should have a messageId reference and that should be used to make it publicly visible when the chat changes visibility to public
[x] Delete previous chat messages should also delete documents created / updated in that range of the conversation
[ ] Define project Name
[ ] Define project styles
[ ] Sign up with GitHub

### Backend
[ ] Clearly define what's an update and what's a tool action in the backend, so that it can be used with more flexibility without changing frontend
[ ] Deep research should have a step in which it decides if the question can be answered or it should continue researching.
[ ] Unify Deep research and reasonSearch
[ ] Add manus-like plan as a document
[ ] Security: User should only be able to see their own chats.
[ ] Migrate routes to TRPC (and use it in the frontend)
[ ] Organize authorization as a layer at the beggining of each trpc

[x] Create a button to Deep Research
[ ] Refactor Model, providers, modelCosts so that it's easier to add new models
[ ] Propagate model selection to deep research / reason tools (and create new selectables for them)


### Frontend
[ ] Improve multimodal input styles for long text
[x] Annotations for search should be less granular, just a list of sites (like perplexity)
[x] Migrate to TRPC with Tanstack Query
[ ] Get model from cache in model selector while loading
[x] Edit message should have multimodal input box (instead of only Send and Cancel)
[x] When viewing shared chat from another user, vote is not allowed. The button is hidden but we are doing the request anyway
[x] Multimodal edit message to wide on mobile (is it using a min-width?)
[ ] Chat history: 
- [ ] Search Chats
- [ ] Virtual list for previous chats
- [ ] Only render last document as preview, others as pill
[x] The multimodal input footer toggles dont fit the screen in artifact view. Should turn into a menu
[x] Artifact editing should be disabled on shared chats (isEditable is false)
[ ] Migrate to tailwind 4 (and migrate container queries)
[ ] Only show the last artifact in the chat as a big preview, others as pills
[ ] Multimodal input on artifact should be hidden in shared chat


### System
[x] Get rid of API keys, just use the backend keys
[x] TBD Create limits per accounts with a few credits
[ ] Chat should be forkable (even shared ones)


[ ] AI SDK 5 ?
[ ] Implement credit budget handling to disalbe tools that can't be on each step by using prepareStep from AI SDK 5




## Auth
[x] Add "Deployment" redirect URI 


PROMPT:

I'm trying to find domain names for a chat with your AI LLM Models application assistant.

Brainstorm 200 names variations I can try with prefixes for a chat application that works with many LLM models and is a helpful assistant.

Prefixes: ly, lio, ify, zen, os, us, in, up, it, er

Only print the roots (without the suffixes) I'll combine them later.

E.g. chat, assistant, assist, help, helper, pair, talk, knowledge, know, knowl, knowle, wise, wis, wisdom, wisdo, etc

Print as a comma separated list in text (no document)
